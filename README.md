# Noah Silver 
Environmental Economist, University of Southern California

Welcome! I am a graduate student at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy interested in energy and environmental economics. I have experience in land use and real estate consulting, carbon accounting and sustainable finance, GHG emissions reduction policy, and agricultural economics research. I hold a bachelor's degree in Political Economy with a minor in Statistics from USC.
I hope to work in the field of environmental economics and policy. My specific interests lie in critical issues of water management and sustainability, non-market valuation, land use and urban development, and transportation.
Originally from the desert oasis of Scottsdale, Arizona, I love the outdoors and enjoy exploring public lands. I am an avid rock climber, iced mocha connoisseur, and a certified beach-aholic.
